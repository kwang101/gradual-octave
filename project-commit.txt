Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%): 100%

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week: MONDAY 2-3PM ROOM 014

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face):
(1 hour) Tutorial on Mondays at 2:00-3:00pm
(2+ hours) Thursdays 5:00 to at least 7:00pm

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. Add refinement and dependent types to Java.

2. Add contracts / gradual typing to Bash.

3. Design a complexity analysis DSL that allows users to define syntax as functions of complexity, and accept code expressions to compute.
